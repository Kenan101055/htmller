    <h1><span>Google earth</span></h1>
    <p><span>Google Earth</span> is a web and computer program that renders a <span style="color: green !important;"> 3D</span> representation of Earth based primarily on satellite imagery. The program maps the Earth by superimposing satellite images, aerial photography, and GIS data onto a <span style="color: green !important;">3D</span> globe, allowing users to see cities and landscapes from various angles. Users can explore the globe by entering addresses and coordinates, or by using a keyboard or mouse. The program can also be downloaded on a smartphone or tablet, using a touch screen or stylus to navigate. Users may use the program to add their own data using Keyhole Markup Language and upload them through various sources, such as forums or blogs. Google Earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the Earth and is also a Web Map Service client. In 2019, Google revealed that <span> Google Earth</span> now covers more than 97 percent of the world, and has captured <span style="color: green !important;"> 10 million miles </span>of Street View imagery.</p>
